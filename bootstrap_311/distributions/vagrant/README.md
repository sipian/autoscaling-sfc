# Open Baton via Vagrant

If you already have Vagrant installed in your system, you can install the latest RELEASE Open Baton version by using this [Vagrantfile] (https://github.com/openbaton/bootstrap/blob/develop/distributions/vagrant/Vagrantfile) and simply typing the following command:  

```bash
vagrant up
```

After the starting of the vagrant box has finished, you can open a browser and go on localhost:8080.
To log in, the default credentials for the administrator user are:
* user: admin
* password: openbaton
